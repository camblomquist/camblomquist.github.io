My name is Cameron Blomquist. I have five hundred business cards that say I am a Junior Software Engineer at [MACH](https://www.mach.io/). At the office, I spend most of my time working with C++ to make off-road vehicles drives themselves. And resisting the temptation to rewrite it in Rust.

I had always taken an interest in science and math but didn't get started with code and software development until I took a computer science course in my senior year of high school. It was either that or continuing with the orchestra that I joined six years prior where I was consistently last chair second violin. I think I made the right choice.

In 2020, I was diagnosed with ADHD which explained a good bit of the previous fifteen years of my life. I still struggle with it and I have a neverending list of projects that will likely never see completion. It took four years from the time I decided to start a blog to actually start the blog. I like to think I'm doing better though.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camblomquist) and [GitHub](https://github.com/camblomquist). If you're curious about what I'm currently reading, you can find that out on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101998960-cameron-blomquist).
